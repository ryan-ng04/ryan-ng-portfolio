        <p>
            Hey there! I'm an aspiring engineer trying to make my dream of working in tech a reality.
            I'm really into anything that involves big data, cloud, backend programming, databases,
            machine learning, or full-stack development. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me
            watching or (terribly) playing basketball, reading web novels, or hanging out with my girlfriend.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I tend to get hyperfixated on random hobbies. I've gone through phases like playing guitar,
            learning how to pen spin, and even trying to start a mukbang YouTube channel (which my girlfriend
            unfortunately vetoed ðŸ˜…). On the bright side, it means I pick things up quickly and love learning new stuff,
            which definitely helps in tech.
        </p>
